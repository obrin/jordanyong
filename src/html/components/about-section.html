        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>
          Hi there! My name is Jordan, and I'm a Full-Stack Developer with technological and business experience.
          I build responsive applications from simple static websites to more sophisticated web apps.
          I emphasize on rapid development and product iteration, while providing maintainable, modular and tested code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the couple of years, I've worked with iFlix as a software engineer and several other startups as an Entrepreneur in Residence.
          Having worked in both ends of product development and product distribution allows me to work in different mindsets;
          knowing what it takes to build a large scale product from ground up and what it takes to get it from zero to millions of customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me quietly reading or annoying my neighbours on the drum set.
        </p>
